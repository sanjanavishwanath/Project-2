PROJECT TITLE: City Data Project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Use the information in CityData.txt to create interating methods about cities/states and their populations. 
VERSION or DATE:  2/14/2021
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Run the main method of the CityDataRunner class.
AUTHORS: Aadi C. and Sanjana V.
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Always capitalize the name of cities. EX: Austin, not austin. When entering a state, use its abbreviation. EX: Texas = TX. Pay attention to what kind of input the program is asking for. For example, it could give you an error if it wants a String and you input an int.
